# Awx installation script

This script will install the dependencies needed to run to AWX as well as modifying the inventory file. 
There are comments throughout the script to ensure readability.
The outcome of running the script should be that Docker.service is running and the AWX Web UI is up (http://localhost) with modified admin user and password. User: gemini Password: observatory
